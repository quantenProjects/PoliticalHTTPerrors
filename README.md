## What, Why?

404 is famous, but there are many other HTTP status codes. Let us make them famous with quotes from german politicians

There are other great quotes like this one out there:

## 410 - Gone

"Denn eins ist sicher: Die Rente." - Norbert Sebastian Bl√ºm

## Contributing

It is simple, take a [HTTP status code](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP-Statuscode) and combine it with a quote out of german politics. (at best with a source mentioned in the PR)

If you could label the combination with [WITZIG](https://marcuwekling.reimkultur-shop.de/marc-uwe-kling-witzig-nicht-witzig-holzstempel-6400101.html), it is perfect for this collection. But only if the quote is really from the author, no ["wrongly assigned quotes"](http://die-kaenguru-chroniken.wikia.com/wiki/Falsch_zugeordnete_Zitate) please, even if they are very WITZIG.

Make a pull request, copy the [template](https://github.com/quantenProjects/PoliticalHTTPerrors/blob/master/template.html), put your qoute inside and don't forget to add the link to the readme.
